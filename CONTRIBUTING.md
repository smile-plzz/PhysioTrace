### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please create an issue. Describe your idea clearly, explaining the problem it solves or the value it adds.

### Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure your code lints and follows the existing code style.
4.  Make sure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.
5.  Open a pull request, providing a detailed description of the changes.

## Development Setup

1.  Clone the forked repository.
2.  This project uses CDN links in `index.html` for its dependencies, so there is no `npm install` step required.
3.  You can serve the `index.html` file using a simple local server (e.g., Python's `http.server` or the Live Server extension in VS Code).
4.  Ensure you have a valid Google Gemini API key set up in your environment as `API_KEY`.

## Code Style

We use Prettier for code formatting and follow standard TypeScript and React best practices. Please ensure your code is formatted before submitting a pull request.

Thank you for your contribution!
